The COVID-19 pandemic has just simply shook the world. It has changed the lifestyle of the people around the globe. Governments have imposed nation-wide lockdown to control the spread of the deadly virus. For many new businesses, Work from home has become the new reality. Schools and educational institutions have come up with online teaching platforms to get the syllabus covered. The courier and delivery services have started to give non-contact deliveries which doesn't involve hand-to-hand delivery.

So, how has the pandemic affected the technology sector world-wide? Several organisations have been struggling to get their customers online for certain tasks since a couple of years. But, the current situation has given these organisations a boost to the number of users for their product.

## ONLINE PAYMENTS

Though the cashless payment modes have gained a good amount of users over the past couple of years, certain sectors still failed to transform to the online mode of payments as they felt it was not safe and secure. Traditional modes of payments like cash still has a strong sense of trust in some people.

## VIRTUAL MEETINGS

The next big change that the world would observe would be the hike in remote meetings and online discussions. Though the tools for virtual meetings were available since many years from now, they weren't as functional, as attending the workplace and holding meetings at offices was the trend. Now, that social distancing and consciousness for hygiene has come into play, virtual video meetings and webinars have come up.

Some software commonly used by organisations for meetings and webinars are:
- Join.me
- Microsoft Teams
- Google Meet
- Cisco Webex
- Zoom Cloud Meetings
- Airmeet
- Amazon Chime
- GoToMeeting

From meetings with only 4-5 participants, to huge international seminars and conferences with thousands of participants all have already moved online. This trend is likely to continue in the post COVID world as people maintain social distancing etiquette.

Similarly, online education has also seen a boost over the past couple of months and will continue to be, as crowded classrooms and halls cannot be allowed for at least 2 years from now. Social distancing and student-to-student distance would matter. Even though online education existed, the user base was pretty low. Many universities and school education boards have recommended that schools and colleges should attempt to complete some portion of the curriculum online, even after the situation becomes normal.

## INTERNET BANDWIDTH ANALYSIS

As there is an increased use of the internet all over the world, artificial Intelligence would be playing a major role for the communication industry to analyse and speculate the data and bandwidth usage by people. When communication is being done using shared spectrum AI/ML systems will be continuously monitoring the load on the various networks. Based on the spectrum usage the machine learning algorithm would work to shift the communication channel to a spectrum where there is lesser traffic and help in making the connection more stable. These systems will help greatly improve the user experience. Everything is moving to the online space. So control and monitoring of the usage is important as the traffic might generate a negative effect.

Internet will be available to the rural areas too. Due to the outbreak of the pandemic, there have been losses in many jobs due to which people are moving from cities to their own rural areas in search of work. With them, they are also carrying the urban facilities as a necessity like, 24/7 internet facility and so on. So, there will be a great development of technology being used in the rural areas too which is a very good news.

## EMERGING IoT SOLUTIONS

People would generally refrain touching switches and knobs used by everybody in the public places and workplaces. IoT brings us the possibility of resolving this with just connecting one primary device we have, for controlling everything. Be it lights, AC, Fans, Televisions, Projectors, etc being controlled with just our tablets/laptops or mobiles. IoT holds the power of connecting all devices to the cloud and securely control these devices with a common control to people who will be given access to operate it. Electric switches and remote controls will slowly get outdated and the new controls will be gestures and personalized single device control for all the device we will be given access to. Isn't it wonderful?

Another major pick-point that tech can bring us with the situation is decreased crime rates and increased security. Solutions that connect the cloud and satellite tracing technology can help with the problem described. With contact-tracing in place, there might be a chance to control the crimes happening around us. A similar concept can be applied by the police and crime departments to catch hold of criminals and control the crime rate. Therefore, the current situation of the pandemic is an advantage to the growth of the technology sector which has given rise to a lot of solutions.
