Wondering what this new article is about? Before getting to the next part of this article, try to think deeper with just the Heading in mind. Any ideas or guesses? Well, this article is all about the automation industry's development and how much further could it develop. Does it possess risk for the human jobs right now? Will machines replace humans in the future of work?

Study claims that robots could take over 20 million jobs by 2030. While researchers predicted the rise of robots will bring about benefits in terms of productivity and economic growth, they also acknowledged the drawbacks that were expected to arise simultaneously.

## The 80-20 Principle

We all should be knowing about the Pareto Principle or the 80-20 law. It states that 20 percent of the administration tasks that humans perform should be responsible for the other 80 percent of the automatic tasks performed. But, knowing that working with keeping this principle in mind, it is a threat to humans themselves in the long run.

Industries and MNCs would surely prefer to replace bots with humans as the efficiency rate would increase, prone to lesser errors, would cut costs.

On the contrary, there is a lots of talk online regarding the same topic. There are a lot of mixed reactions in the people. Humans can do certain jobs that the machines cannot do still.

## Human Creativity vs Machine Efficiency

Innovation and new inventions can only be the result of a human's creativity and analysis. Machines are only instructed to do a specific job.

Though Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a sector of IT industry is the fastest growing segment now, building the artificial intelligence industry is only the work of the human brain. If the machines are automated to build new bots based on the requirements and situation of the current time, they can only do the same task repeatedly.

## Pitfalls of Automation

In fact, there are some major pitfalls when it comes to automation:

**Time and effort**: A person can think of building automation into something only when it requires to do the job repeatedly and also faster than humans for the same job.

**Time to Automate < (Time to Perform x Number of Times)**

If the above equation holds True, only then a person can think of automating a task.

**Automation is Agile**: Automation really requires a human support at the back-end to keep itself updated and keep developing the process/machine. As mentioned above, innovation can be fed into the machine to perform a new task. But the machine itself cannot get innovative ideas on its own.

Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

Agile development has taken a huge leap into the IT Industry. This methodology is used for incremental software releases.

**The steps included in this methodology include:**
1. Prerequisites
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Release
6. Tracking and Monitoring
7. Deploying the process again for a new version release

This is a very vast deployment process in the software industry. Hence, this has to be repeatedly checked and rolled out as per the requirements and suitability. Lots of time and effort has to be invested to deploy automation using Agile methodology cycle. Hence, it can be considered as a pitfall.

## The Balance Between Humans and Machines

In the manufacturing and production lines, robots and machines have already taken over some of the manual jobs that were done before and used to be a very tiring and difficult job for the humans.

The point is that humans and technology must work together, humans in control and the technology providing what it is programmed to provide. The idea that technology will replace the need for creative thinking, problem-solving, leadership, teamwork and initiative is rather silly right now. The idea that humans can leverage technology to provide a better world for all of us is not silly, however.

Why this variance? Because no one can predict accurately exactly all of the jobs that robots and AI will assume from humans over the next few decades. We just don't know where the technology will take us. At the same time, we cannot predict the numbers of new jobs/careers that new technology will create.

One study from Gartner Research states that while 1.8 million jobs will be lost by 2020, 2.3 million new ones will be created.

## Conclusion

So, will machines replace humans for many jobs? The answer is unequivocal, yes. However, I assert that with every job taken over by machines, there will be an equal number of opportunities for jobs to be done by people. Some of these human jobs will be of the creative type. Others will require humans to hone their superhuman reasoning skills.

In many cases, humans and machines maintain a symbiotic relationship where each one holds its own place. Helping each other do their work efficiently.
