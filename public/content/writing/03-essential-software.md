This blog post is all about the real essential software everybody must have. These software are very useful and help make the users work to be more efficient and output oriented. Let's have a look at them!

## 1) Adobe Photoshop

Many of us might have heard about this software everywhere in the large scale industries where image and photo editing is a must. Here are some common features that Adobe Photoshop has to offer:

- **Photoshop layers**: Layering is the fundamental of photo editing. Add layers and edit all the way onto the layers before applying it onto the original image.
- **High range of selection tools** which give you a professional edit (cropping, slicing, moving, marquee, lasso, magic wand, eraser)
- **Pen Tool**: This tool creates specific paths with adjustable anchor points.
- **Shape Tool**: Maintaining a particular shape without losing its originality enhances the end-result for designers.
- **Vector Mask**: Making numerous changes on the layers applied on the image such as shades, contrast, density, feathering, colors or brush tools.
- **Retouching Tools**: This tool is often used when there is a requirement of another fine enhancement in the image. This is also called image correction.
- **3-D Extrusion**: Several elements in Adobe Photoshop can be transformed to 3D with just a click of the mouse.
- **Smart Objects**: It intelligently keeps the image data and helps restore its original quality irrespective of the level of editing on the canvas.

Adobe Photoshop is a subscription based service via Adobe Creative Cloud which lets users seamlessly sync files across various devices.

## 2) VLC Media Player

Video LAN project in 1986. Now, merely one of the best video players for our PCs. Available for free, this software seamlessly integrates with the files, devices, streams and webcams to offer users with the high video quality in no time. We know that VLC allows us to play media files but do all of us know the high number of hidden features in the application? What makes it different from the other good media players for PC?

- **Converter**: It has an in-built video converter which changes the encoding and file format as required by the user. We don't need a different software for converting videos.
- **Streaming media from PC to other Client**: VLC can act as both server and client for streaming and receiving network streams. We just have to fill in the IP addresses into both the systems to stream simultaneously. This can be useful in companies where an instruction can be sent to all the employees using a video.
- **Streaming and downloading online videos**: VLC has the potential to stream and download videos from various online video play platforms. Just entering the URL in the desired location will do so. The codec will initially run on your browser where you can select to save your file locally. This is of great use.
- **Equalizer**: VLC can act as a graphic equalizer for the overall sound on your system, not only the media you play through VLC.
- **Radio and Podcasts**: Another feature which most of the users wouldn't have noticed on the player is the ability to stream podcasts and radio. You can choose from different stations around the globe to listen to them. Though various music streaming platforms have come into industry, VLC is also a great option.
- **Watermark**: For video editors or film makers who want to copyright their content can add their watermark on the video without any extra effort.

And lot more with extensions and add-ons.

## 3) Notepad ++

Similar to the windows notepad, this software is a text editor too. But what makes it stand out is the number of text editing options and compatibility with different programming languages. Notepad ++ is the text editor made for developers. It is open-source and is completely free to use. Deeply thought, one of the very unique aspects of Notepad++ is to reduce the world's carbon dioxide emissions by optimizing the number of routines it runs, which in turn uses lesser CPU power. This is good when though on the large scale.

**Popular features of Notepad ++:**

1. **Internationalization**: It is one of the very few source code editors that supports internationalization using XML files. In order to translate to a new language all you can do is edit the existing file.

2. **Plugins Support**: Notepad ++ lets you have plugins for each and every requirement of yours. Only catch to be that the installation is supposed to be in the built-in plugin manager. A few popular plugins: Compare, Combine, FTP, Plugin manager, etc.

3. **Customizable UI**: One of the effortless but useful adjustments in Notepad ++ is control of whether the tabs align vertically or horizontally or one behind the other with each having its own close button. Split screen work is also possible with this application. This program comes with multiple themes to choose from. You can also customize the keyboard shortcuts based on your needs.

4. **Auto - Complete**: Notepad++ is capable of two types of auto completion i.e auto completion of words, auto completion of functions. This makes coding faster and error free.

5. **Search and Replace**: It is quite advanced in Notepad++ as you can find and replace in the current file or also in multiple files as per your setting.

6. **Syntax highlighting**: This option allows user to highlight a few words they want to edit. This makes it easy for the user to spot the words required when the code is opened again.

Way to go Coders! This is the software for you!

This app bridges the gap between editing screenshots and snipping on phone and PC.

**Its unique features include:**
