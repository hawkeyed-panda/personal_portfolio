What if you are wondering with an empty rack in your kitchen to get essential supplies but are unsure about which shop is open during the lock down in your area? At a time like this, if we do not know which stores are open we end up wasting a lot of time wandering around and thereby ruining the whole purpose of this lock down — which is to maintain social distancing. Where can I get my supplies from? Is the shop actually open? What if I get caught by the police midway? I'm sure many of you would be filled with these thoughts. So, here on this post, are a couple of apps/sites you can use to clear a part of your confusion.

## 1) STILLOPEN.IN

If we knew in advance what stores are open around us, it would make our store-runs simpler and waste less time and keep us safer (less contact with people, no loitering).

Quikr (the online buying and selling portal) has created a website called stillopen.in that can help us do this right. Here's a snapshot of the website interface showing you the options available on it. It would ask permission for location access, you may accept or deny the permission. You can manually enter your location later if you haven't given permission access to the site. You can browse through various options like, grocery stores, doctors around you, pharmacy around you etc. Also you have an option to update the data on the website as well. If you have been to the place, and unfortunately find out that the info on the website is wrong you can update the info on it to prevent people from further coming to that place on that day.

stillopen.in is currently available for access in 23 cities including Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Gwalior, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Lucknow, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Patna, Indore, Jaipur, Kochi, Chandigarh, Coimbatore and Secunderabad.

## 2) AAROGYA SETU APP

I've personally tried and explored this app on my phone. This app also uses the user's location data and collects some personal health data like Name, Age, fitness. Later it takes a small symptom test which the user can truthfully answer. After the test, the user can know what action to be taken next based on the symptoms. If the person seems to have no symptoms, it suggests the user to stay at home as he/she is not infected so as to prevent further chances of infection. This app uses Bluetooth and location services to maintain its health database. The home page of the app shows if you are safe in a green background and if it's time for yourself to get checked in red.

If the app is installed by the majority of the smartphone using population in the country, it can be really helpful and the analytics of the app will be accurate. The next major feature of the app is that it would alert you when you are near or pass by a person with the symptoms of the novel coronavirus. So that you maintain to stay away or get yourself immediately checked for further contact prevention.

## Government Initiative

'The Aarogya Setu app is an essential tool in COVID-19 fight and one could use it as an e-pass to facilitate travel from one place to another', said Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The PM spoke about the tracking application during his video conference meeting with state chief ministers, as they discussed the extension of India's current lockdown situation. Prime Minister Modi, reportedly, "spoke about popularising the Aarogya Setu app to ensure downloads in greater numbers". This feature hasn't come up yet, and the app soon would be updated as per the Prime Minister's announcement.

This is a great feature if people really have a need to go out for emergency supplies, and are accidentally caught by the police. They can then show this pass as a proof of approval. But my personal recommendation for this feature would be if only a limited number of users get approval for this pass for a limited amount of time like for approximately 30 minutes as, this time is lot more than enough for people to get basic supplies from the nearest stores. Also this pass should be restricted to a particular area so that people don't travel far away from their homes.

Similar to how South Korea and Singapore got success in contact tracing, PM Modi said, "based on those experiences, India has made its own effort through the app which will be an essential tool in India's fight against the pandemic. The Aarogya Setu app is expected to help the Government in taking necessary timely steps for assessing risk of spread of COVID-19 infection, and ensuring isolation where required.

Follow the government's latest guidance on safeguarding yourself during the coronavirus pandemic, including travel advice within and outside the country. The World Health Organization has also busted some myths surrounding coronavirus. The Ministry of Health's special helpline is available at +91-11-23978046, ncov2019@gmail.com and ncov2019@gov.in.
