Can the new iPad 2020 replace your laptop with the refreshed new iPad OS and added mouse/trackpad support? With added mouse support, the iPads are inching closer to the real laptop replacement. Previously iPads were developed with a touch-only interaction. Firstly, talking about the new iPadOS which had launched in September 2019 was a huge change to the complete iPad ecosystem. It had brought in iPad specific features which drag the iPads and the laptops closer.

## 1) Multitasking

Swiping from the bottom gives a whole lot new experience for multitasking.

## 2) Desktop browsing in Safari

You can now load desktop webpages on Safari just like in your laptop. Previously the iOS could load mobile or tablet versions of the webpages. This new desktop-class Safari isn't yet the equal of Safari on the Mac, but it's an impressive effort. If there are sites you couldn't get to work with mobile Safari before, give them a try in iPadOS and let us know how it works.

## 3) The Home Screen now has a greater app icon density

Meaning, to hold more apps at one glance. And the best part of this feature? Apple has added the today view panel on the left of the home screen giving the information without swiping to the left.

## 4) Another great feature apple has worked on for iPads is the floating keyboard

Which allows one handed slide-typing when the iPad is on the hand. The keyboard becomes smaller than the actual one and can be used with one finger.

## 5) Better mark-up and screenshots with the Apple Pencil

It allows you to take screenshots with the pencil just by swiping from the bottom of your screen. Now, here comes the real feature.

## ADDED MOUSE INTEGRATION

Apple has made really good efforts striking the mouse support into the iPads. The new magic keyboard comes with a thin folio attached to it which protects the whole iPad and gives a floating design to it which looks similar to the mac. The backlit keyboard also helps typing in the dark and also adjusts the brightness of the backlit using iPad's sensors. Pretty cool right?

Coming to the trackpad, the gestures used on the screen to navigate through the iPadOS has also been ported to the trackpad. A small circular cursor is used in place of a pointed arrow to retain the feel of touch on the software. Another great workaround with the magic keyboard is the location of the type-C port. It's just located at the corner of the hinge and is a perfect location to work with the iPad while its charging just like a laptop!

## The Final Verdict

Coming to the final answer to the question, Apple has really made great efforts getting the iPad and laptop closer. For most people who have to work with browsing the internet, entertainment, productivity apps like MS Office, Adobe Reader, basic sound and photo editing the iPad is a great device.

But for power users (a user of a computer system or program whose skills and expertise are more advanced than most other users) and developers, the iPad is not the device for them yet. Coding and software development capabilities aren't present in the iPad even though it is a very powerful machine. Also for gamers, iPad is really not for them which only supports mobile games on it. So, it's just the matter of work preference.

The below image shows the preference of different users on an instagram poll. The poll indicates that most users prefer a lighter and more user-friendly device.
