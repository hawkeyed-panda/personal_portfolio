Smartphone users all over the world have been waiting for OnePlus to launch a true flagship that can finally battle against the top phones of the smartphone industry.

Until now OnePlus had been launching high-end phones which cannot be called as complete flagships due to the decent camera performance and the lack of IP rating for phones.

With the newly announced OnePlus 8 series, the company has set the limits to the top for a very competitive price with quality.

## Design Philosophy

The punch-hole camera is a noticeable distraction on the screen while playing full screen content but the reason for OnePlus to change from the pop-up camera system is quite obvious even though the pop-up system was a hit.

To reduce the number of open groves on the body of the phone for the added IP rating of the phone.

Coming to the design, the phone has got slimmer and a better aesthetic to just fit right into the hand.

With a contoured Matte AG glass finish the design delivers an unparalleled look and feel.

The back is fingerprint resistant and just irresistible to hold.

OxygenOS is smart, swift and efficient with intuitive features designed with you in mind.

Also the added range of customization which makes you feel that the phone is uniquely yours.

## Pricing

The OnePlus 8 Pro starts from ₹54,999 and the slightly fit-in-pocket model in the OnePlus 8 series, the OnePlus 8 starts from ₹44,999.
