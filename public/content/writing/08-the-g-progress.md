We are in the 21st century knowing that the internet services have took a giant leap. The mobile network services have expanded into broad businesses. But, my question to the telecom operators, is it really worth expanding so huge? Is the radiation safe? Is the data safe? Is the network reliable? Is the network coverage complete?

## The Evolution of Mobile Networks

We have wide variety of mobile networks starting from GSM which is used for voice communications/calls. Next enters the data transfer type technology which is Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) also popularly known as 2G which is currently less in regular use as the costs of data packs for high speed internet have come down. The maximum speeds this offers is 384kbps. But, do we really receive atleast half of the maximum speed the band can offer? Is the cost cutting technique really benefiting the telecom customers?

## Quality vs Speed

There is a heavy compromise on the quality of networks over the increasing number of 'G's over the years. Is this what everybody expects? We have come over the years using 3G and 4G LTE which offer better and faster speeds than EDGE and GPRS. The telecom operators fail to keep a check over the coverage and quality of the network as the 'G's progress. At present, we are entering the 5G age and do we really think that 4G works perfectly fine everywhere to the expectations so as to move on to the next generation for communication?

Reports from LocalCircles give the following data on a survey:

Bringing down costs for matching up to the competition in the market has also got the top performing telecom operators into trouble incurring loss and a very high debt pay to the Department of Telecommunications, Government of India. This has also led the companies to reduce the operating costs and also hike the prices of data packs by up to 40%.

## The Way Forward

In fact, it would be better when telecom operators try offering promised data speeds instead of reducing operation costs so that the consumer base increases and the revenue is recovered from quality offering to the customers of the network. The marginal cost would adjust on its own according to the preference of the customers.

Hence, the hope that 5G would bring higher transfer speeds should stay on as it is a new spectrum and might revolutionize the mobile network industry.
