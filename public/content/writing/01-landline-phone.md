The tech holds very strong and supporting reasons so as why people should be keeping landline phones. Did we ever think if the cellular networks that we are completely reliable on, would completely break-down? After all they are wireless connections which are still not 100% reliable. Currently the telecom operators are suffering to keep up to the standards (a connection to my blog post 'The G Progress'). 

Landline phones still run on underground cables or fiber optics which have lesser chances of reduced quality and call dropouts. Introducing HD voice calling on landline technology would be interesting. Audio data compression would not occur which would result in good voice quality and hassle free calls.

## Reliability in Remote Areas

Have we ever thought about hilly areas or places where wireless communication is not possible? Well, people who stay there would know it better. Considering the fact that they are not portable and not easy to carry everywhere, it is obvious that it stays as a backup or a reliable source of communication even if the cell phone breaks or spoils, the network collapses due to power outage or any other reasons. Lesser consumption of energy and cheaper operation costs are also the factors that first come into the mind when comparing mobiles and landline phones.

## The Wireless Everything Trend

Now that the generation is going 'EVERYTHING WIRELESS' say wireless earphones, WiFi, wireless charging, etc. the landline phones are going extinct. Letting the technology of land phones go off is a bad idea. Even today the home security system use wired telecommunication systems just sticking to the fact of reliability. The workplaces also use land phones as intercom connections for speaking with colleagues or employees for clear audio and faster connections for urgent work. FAX still run on the telephone lines which run without any trouble whereas we repeatedly face issues wireless printing documents from our laptops or mobiles.

## Privacy and Security

Thinking and comparing to the age when we used to use cell phones only for voice calls and SMS, now the smartphones can leak any amount of our personal data just for serving the primary purpose of talking to a friend or relative we know miles away. Personal data is at stake for the primary purpose of voice calls and text communication whereas SMS texts are secure and encrypted.

## Health Considerations

Coming to another side effect of using too much cell phone for voice call is the radiation level the cell phone emits. We put the cell phone close to our head for a long time which causes long term health issues. Using earphones also is a solution anyway.

Concluding the article, usage of cell phone has a lot of advantages over landline but completely scrapping landline phones and the wired mode of communication is not recommended.
